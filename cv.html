I have also worked as both a producer and designer/developer on a number of smaller group and individual projects.

            <p class="card-text">During lockdown I made many friends playing "Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege" many of these friends being notable content creators. I decided to take a personal interest further and begin streaming myself gaming. I now regularly run my own stream and have attended various LAN events in the R6 Esports calendar. Recently I became a Ubisoft Creator and was recognised for my passion doing something I love. I run multiple Discord communities for larger streamers as well as my own. It has been a steep learning curve but I feel my ability to learn new skills and produce a live show has been demonstrated well by this.</p>
